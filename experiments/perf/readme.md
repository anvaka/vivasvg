Trying to measure performance of RAF vs setInterval.

* [Rendering of 8k circles with raf](http://anvaka.github.com/vivasvg/experiments/perf/raf/index.html?n=8000)
* [Rendering of 8k circles with setInterval](http://anvaka.github.com/vivasvg/experiments/perf/setInterval/index.html?n=8000)

Open dev tools and enable FPS counter. Looks like both methods perform at exactly the same speed.
